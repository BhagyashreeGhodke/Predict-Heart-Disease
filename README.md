Title:
Predictive Modeling and Risk Factor Analysis for Heart Disease Using BRFSS Data

Abstract:
Heart disease remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, underscoring the need for early detection and preventive healthcare. This project leverages data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) for the years 2013–2015, encompassing health, demographic, and lifestyle information for approximately 300,000 individuals. The binary target variable, HeartDiseaseorAttack (0 = No, 1 = Yes), presents a significant class imbalance, with only a small proportion of positive cases, posing challenges for accurate prediction.

To address this, the dataset was meticulously preprocessed through cleaning, encoding, scaling, and applying class imbalance mitigation techniques. Machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting were developed to predict heart disease risk. Model performance was evaluated using Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, prioritizing the accurate identification of at-risk individuals.

Beyond predictive modeling, the project also aimed to uncover key risk factors—such as age, BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and physical activity—that contribute to heart disease. To enhance interpretability and facilitate decision-making, interactive Tableau dashboards were created to visualize trends, demographic distributions, and the influence of lifestyle factors. These insights support more informed public health strategies and personalized preventive care
