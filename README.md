Title:
HeartSmart AI: Decoding Lifestyle's Role in Cardiovascular Risk Through Machine Learning

Abstract:

Heart disease is one of the top causes of death worldwide, making early detection and prevention essential.

This project studies how lifestyle choices affect heart health by analyzing the relationship between personal habits and heart disease risk. The analysis covers key factors like smoking, exercise, diet, and mental health.

We used a large dataset of 300,000 records that includes demographic, behavioral, and medical information. A scalable data pipeline was built using PySpark on Hadoop for fast processing, SQL for structured data storage, and Python for building predictive models. The pipeline includes automated feature engineering and techniques to handle class imbalance.

To understand what drives risk, we used SHAP analysis, which highlighted factors such as lack of physical activity and high blood pressure.

The system offers:

A Flask-based web app for personalized heart disease risk assessment.

Interactive Tableau dashboards for monitoring population-level heart health.

By combining data science with healthcare, this project supports personalized prevention for individuals and helps policymakers target high-risk groups with effective public health strategies.
