Title:
HeartSmart AI: Predicting Cardiovascular Risk with ML

Abstract:
	
Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, stressing the importance of early detection and prevention. This project explores how lifestyle factors smoking, physical activity, diet, and mental health impact heart disease risk.
We analyzed 900,000 records with demographic, behavioral, and clinical data. A scalable pipeline using PySpark on Hadoop and Pandas enabled efficient data processing. Data was stored in MySQL for structured management. 
Thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and preprocessing such as handling missing values and encoding categorical variables ensured data quality.Predictive models including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression were built using Google Colab.The project features a Flask web app for personalized risk assessment and interactive Tableau dashboards for visualization. It is deployed on Render for reliable, scalable access.
